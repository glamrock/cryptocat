## Security

### How to report security issues
Any security issue, regardless of severity, should be reported via full disclosure. Please open an issue on our GitHub tracker. If you are uncomfortable opening an issue on our GitHub tracker, please send an email to nadim@crypto.cat.
 
### Communication expectations
Depending on the severity of the security issue, response times will vary. Medium to severe security issues are almost guaranteed a same-day response.
 
### Credit
Depending on the nature and severity of the security issue, the reporter will receive due credit on the [Cryptocat Wall of Eternal Greatness](https://crypto.cat/bughunt/), the [Development Blog](https://blog.crypto.cat), and on our Twitter, GitHub and Changelog.
