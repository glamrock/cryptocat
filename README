IMPORTANT NOTES:
-Paranoid users may want to install Cryptocat Verifier, a Chrome extension that verifies that your Cryptocat session is not serving you modified JavaScript code.
Cryptocat verifier can be downloaded here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dlafegoljmjdfmhgoeojifolidmllaie

-The code for secure deletion of idle chats after 30 minutes is not included in the Cryptocat git repository. On the production server at crypto.cat, it's actually a cron job that checks the modification time of chats and wipes them securely using wipe (http://linux.die.net/man/1/wipe.) People wanting to set up similar functionality on their server should consider writing a similar cron job.
